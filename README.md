# OPC-UA Tests and Samples

This project provides samples for using OPC-UA in different languages with different implementations.

In addition some use-cases and edge-case with typical issues are 
described and enriched with specific tests showing those scenarios in detail.

The samples are meant to be "clean" references for the respective environment.

## OPC-UA issues

OPC-UA is an important IIoT standard, but has several - even certified -
implementations for client and server side that not necessarily are perfect interoperable,
e.g. in terms of protocol and timeout behaviour, connection and session handling.

May be this project helps a bit to find new issues and new solutions for the respective environment.
